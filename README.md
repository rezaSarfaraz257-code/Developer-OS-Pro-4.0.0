# Developer OS 4.0.0 — Unified Production Edition

Developer OS is a developer operating environment: one workspace for projects, tasks, knowledge, tools, workflows, GitHub context, AI assistance, collaboration, activity and delivery intelligence.

This repository is the **unified 3.0.0 production release line**, merged from the supplied SaaS Mature and Production Validation Ready artifacts. It is not an MVP/demo repository.

## Product surface

- Public developer catalog: tools, resources and workflows
- Secure accounts: registration, JWT access/refresh rotation and logout revocation
- Developer profile and identity
- Project workspace with status, priority, deadlines, tags and stack metadata
- Tasks, notes, snippets and activity
- Favorites/bookmarks
- Collaboration and project membership
- Workspace analytics and delivery signals
- AI workspace assistant with optional OpenAI-compatible provider
- GitHub OAuth with PKCE, repository discovery and activity synchronization
- **Independent Developer OS repositories with server-side commits, push/pull, history, branches and clone**
- Production Docker stack: React/Vite + Nginx + Django/Gunicorn + PostgreSQL
- Security headers, HTTPS-aware settings, upload validation and encrypted GitHub credentials
- CI configuration and release validation documentation

## Technology baseline

- React 19 + Vite 8
- Django 5.2 + Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL 17
- SimpleJWT
- Docker / Nginx / Gunicorn
- GitHub REST API
- Optional OpenAI-compatible AI provider

## Production launch

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Replace every placeholder secret and domain.
3. Configure HTTPS at the hosting edge.
4. Configure GitHub OAuth callback and credentials if GitHub integration is enabled.
5. Build and start:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

6. Create the first administrator:

```bash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. Verify:

```text
GET https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/health/
```

Expected response includes `status=ok` and `database=ok`.

8. Execute the release gate described in `FINAL_RELEASE.md` before opening the service to users.

## Security model

- Production requires a real `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`.
- PostgreSQL is the production database in Docker.
- JWT refresh tokens rotate and are blacklisted on logout.
- Project/task/note access is checked against ownership or collaboration membership.
- Uploaded avatars are validated, normalized and re-encoded.
- GitHub tokens are encrypted at rest.
- GitHub OAuth uses state plus PKCE.
- Shared catalogs are public-read and staff-write.
- API throttling is enabled.
- HTTPS, HSTS, secure cookies, clickjacking and content-type protections are enabled in production.
- Independent repository paths reject traversal patterns and enforce file-count, per-file and total working-tree limits.

## Independent Repository Fabric

Developer OS now includes a repository layer that does **not** require GitHub. It uses the existing persistent Web IDE workspace as the working tree and stores immutable commit snapshots inside the Developer OS platform. This is intentionally separate from the optional GitHub integration.

Available operations:

- Create and list private repositories
- Working-tree persistence shared with the Web IDE
- Commit snapshots with SHA-256 content-addressed identifiers
- Push and pull against the Developer OS repository store
- Branch checkout and branch-specific history
- Repository cloning
- Commit history with parent relationships and file counts
- Per-user authorization and isolation
- Path traversal protection and repository size limits

The management console is available at `/repositories.html` after the frontend is built. The normal Web IDE can open the same repository workspaces, so repository management and coding remain one workflow.

## GitHub integration

The current integration uses a GitHub OAuth App with configurable scopes and PKCE. For installations that need organization-scale automation or tightly scoped repository permissions, GitHub recommends GitHub Apps because they provide fine-grained permissions and short-lived tokens. The integration boundary is intentionally isolated so the authentication provider can evolve without changing the workspace model.

cd Backend
python -m venv .venv
# activate the environment

python manage.py seed_catalog
python manage.py runserver
```

Frontend:

## Product principle

Developer OS is designed as a durable product foundation. New releases should add capabilities or integrations; they should not require rewriting the core workspace, identity, authorization or deployment architecture.

## License

The repository does not currently declare an open-source license. Treat it as proprietary unless a license is added by the owner.

## Release hardening

The current release also provides a cross-catalog search endpoint, API request correlation IDs, authentication throttling, GitHub disconnect/repository filtering, runtime production-readiness checks, and a React error-recovery boundary. The public catalog is data-driven rather than dependent on fabricated ratings or static counts.

## Developer OS Pro — Platform Upgrade

This release extends the workspace into a full developer control plane:

- **Context-aware Intelligence**: persisted AI conversations/messages and project-aware context across projects, tasks, notes and snippets.
- **Universal Search**: authenticated cross-entity search for projects, tasks, notes, snippets plus the public developer catalog.
- **Collaboration Fabric**: project comments, organization/team membership, roles, invites foundation and task dependencies.
- **Web IDE**: persistent browser workspaces, file tree, multi-file editor, terminal panel and project launch surface.
- **Independent Repository Fabric**: private repositories, commit snapshots, push/pull, branches, history and cloning without a GitHub account.
- **SaaS foundation**: subscription/entitlement state, organizations and developer API keys with one-time secret issuance.
- **Production discipline**: migrations, API boundaries, security controls, health/readiness endpoints and CI/security workflows.

### Important execution boundary

The Web IDE intentionally does **not** execute arbitrary user code inside the Django web process. The Run action records the execution intent and exposes a safe integration boundary for an isolated runner/worker. A production deployment should connect this to a sandboxed job system (for example, isolated containers with strict CPU, memory, filesystem and network limits).

Payment providers are also intentionally provider-agnostic: subscription state and entitlements are persisted locally, while a verified provider webhook can synchronize external billing state.

## Global SaaS Release 2.0

This repository is the consolidated production product surface. It includes the Developer OS command center, Explore catalog, projects/workspaces, AI intelligence, GitHub integration, collaboration, notifications, API keys, billing integration, Web IDE/runner, PostgreSQL deployment and security controls.

Paid billing requires real Stripe credentials and price IDs. AI and GitHub are similarly configured through environment variables; the application fails closed for paid billing instead of fabricating successful purchases.
